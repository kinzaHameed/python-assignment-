# 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a 
# variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
# • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print 
# a message that the player just earned 5 points.
# • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that 
# fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
alien_color = "green" , "yellow", "red"
if alien_color :'green'
print("the player just earned 5 points.")

Alien_color:str ="yellow"
if Alien_color: "green"
print("the player just earned 5 points")

# Assign a color other than 'green' to the variable alien_color
alen_color = 'red'

# Test whether the alien's color is green
if alien_color == 'green':
    print("The player just earned 5 points!")
